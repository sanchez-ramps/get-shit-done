## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Init]: Use `acli` CLI wrapper (not custom REST API) — simplifies auth, reduces maintenance
- [Init]: Initiative for Milestone requires Jira Advanced Roadmaps
- [Init]: Manual conflict resolution (safest approach, avoids data loss)
- [Init]: Fixed-duration auto sprints as default mode

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Research]: acli sprint commands need syntax verification during Phase 5
- [Research]: Initiative issue type requires Advanced Roadmaps — need fallback strategy
